    <h3>Childhood and Family</h3>
    <p><strong><big>Elon Reeve Musk</big></strong> was born on <small><strike>June 29, 1972</strike> </small> june 28,1971 in Pretoria, South Africa <sup>[1]</sup>. His mother is <em>Maye Musk</em>, a model and dietitian born in <i>Saskatchewan, Canada,</i>  but raised in South Africa. His father is <em>Errol Musk</em>, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer.Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal <small>(born 1972)</small>, and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian, and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere, a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted. Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he describes as <mark>"a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."</mark> He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's <sub>side</sub>.</p>
    
    <p>Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20. He learned computer programming using a manual and, by age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500. An awkward and introverted child, Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs.He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.</p>

	<p>Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada, Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed Musk to avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill. In 1990, Musk entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.</p>
    <p>In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games. In 1995, Musk was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California. Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries. He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet startup.</p>

    <h3>Tesla </h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-4#tesla" target="_blank">Tesla</a>, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman. Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[86] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm. Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008. A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.</p>
